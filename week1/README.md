Week 1
-----

- Examples of RecSys models in production.
- Formalization of the ranking (recommender systems) task (2 popular types of tasks, 2 types of data sets). 
- Ranking functions (BPR, WARP, RankNET, LambdaRank).
- Metrics for the quality estimation (Hitrate, Precision@k, Recall@k, MAP@k, NDCG@k).
- Taxonomy of RecSys approaches ([MF, FM, CF & other general], Content-based [including knowledge graph based, GB for ranking], Context-based, Sequential and session-based models, RL-based models, Hybrid [including two-level cascade]) approaches.
- Recommended sources on RecSys.
